/**
 * A Java {@link KeyStore} brute-force password finder.
 *
 * With my Intel Core2Quad machine, I can test about 140k passwords/second,
 * using a setting of 10 threads (Linux).
 *
 * Please experiment with the settings best suited for your machine.
 *
 * Why did I write this program? Because I lost my keystore password and
 * I was na?ve enough to think I could actually restore it =)
 *
 * With my machine, I can cover all 6 letter passwords (a-z,A-Z,0-9) in
 * 4.7 days. I can cover all 7 letter passwords in 291 days and all 8
 * letter passwords in about 49.5 years.
 *
 * You can get much better performance if you reduce the character set
 * e.g. if you know roughly which letters were used, but will of course
 * perform worse if you decide to add characters (many people use special
 * characters like !, @ or # in their passwords).
 *
 * Good luck.
